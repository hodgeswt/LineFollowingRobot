# LineFollowingRobot
The source code for my arduino line-following robot.

I designed this robot using "Make an Arduino-Controlled Robot" by Michael Margolis. Unfortunately, both the arduino program and the Adafruit motor shield had been update since then, so none of the code in the book worked. 

This code is designed to allow the robot to follow a line. You only need to have two infrared sensors, attached so that they rest above the non-line surface.

The line can be any color as long as it is darker than the surface on which it is placed.
